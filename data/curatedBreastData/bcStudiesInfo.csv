GSE4913,GPL3558,NA,7470,50,Gene expression profiling of primary breast carcinomas from patients at high risk for local recurrence,17020974,"Purpose: Several risk factors for local recurrence of breast cancer after breast conserving therapy (BCT) have been identified. The identification of additional risk factors would be very useful in guiding optimal therapy and also improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying local recurrence. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify gene expression profiles associated with local recurrence.;	Experimental Design: Using 18K cDNA microarrays, gene expression profiles were obtained from 50 patients who underwent BCT. Of these 50 patients 19 developed a local recurrence; the remaining 31 patients were selected as controls as they were free of local recurrence at least 11 years after treatment. For 9/19 patients also the local recurrence was available for gene expression profiling. Unsupervised and supervised methods of classification were used to separate patients in groups corresponding to disease outcome and to study the overall gene expression pattern of primary tumors and their recurrences.;	Results: Hierarchical clustering of patients did not show any grouping reflecting local recurrence status. Supervised analysis revealed no significant set of genes that was able to distinguish recurring tumors from non-recurring tumors. Paired-data analysis of primary tumors and local recurrences showed a remarkable similarity in gene expression profile between primary tumors and their recurrences.;	Conclusions: No significant differences in gene expression between primary breast cancer tumors in patients with or without local recurrence after breast conserving therapy were identified. Furthermore, analyses of primary tumors and local recurrences show a preservation of the overall gene expression pattern in the local recurrence, even after radiotherapy.;	Keywords: gene expression profiling",NA,"The series contains 50 primary breast carcinomas; 19 of which develop a local recurrence (cases) and 31 remain free from local recurrence for 11 years after therapy (controls).;	In addition this studie group contains 9 recurrences that are the actual recurrence of 9 out the 19 cases.;	--------------------;	31 primary tumors without recurrence:;	GSM110395, GSM110396, GSM110397, GSM110398, GSM110399, GSM110400, GSM110401, GSM110406, GSM110407, GSM110409, GSM110410, GSM110413, GSM110414, GSM110415, GSM110416, GSM110418, GSM110419, GSM110420, GSM110421, GSM110423, GSM110424, GSM110425, GSM110427, GSM110428, GSM110430, GSM110431, GSM110432, GSM110434, GSM110435, GSM110437, GSM110438;	--------------------;	19 primary tumors with recurrence:;	GSM110388, GSM110392, GSM110394, GSM110402, GSM110411, GSM110412, GSM110417, GSM110422, GSM110426, GSM110429, GSM110433, GSM110436, GSM110440, GSM110441, GSM110444, GSM110445, GSM110446, GSM110449, GSM110451;	--------------------;	9 recurrences:;	GSM110391, GSM110439, GSM110442, GSM110443, GSM110447, GSM110448, GSM110450, GSM110452, GSM110453",2
GSE6577,GPL3883,NA,4242,88,Estrogen receptor beta expression is associated with tamoxifen response in ER alpha-negative breast carcinoma,17404078,"Purpose: Endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen are commonly given to most patients with estrogen receptor (ER) alpha-positive breast carcinoma but are not indicated for persons with ERalpha-negative cancer. The factors responsible for response to tamoxifen in 5-10% of patients with ERalpha-negative tumors are not clear. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the biology and role of the second ER, ERbeta, in patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.;	Experimental Design: We investigated ERbeta by immunohistochemistry in 353 stage II primary breast tumors from patients treated with two years adjuvant tamoxifen, and generated gene expression profiles for a representative subset of 88 tumors.;	Results: ERbeta was associated with increased survival (distant disease-free survival, P=0.01; overall survival, P=0.22), and in particular within ERalpha-negative patients (P=0.003; P=0.04), but not in the;	ERalpha-positive subgroup (P=0.49; P=0.88). Lack of ERbeta conferred early relapse (hazard ratio, 14; 95% CI, 1.8-106; P=0.01) within the ERalpha-negative subgroup even after adjustment for other markers. ERalpha was an independent marker only within the ERbeta-negative tumors (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89; P=0.02). An ERbeta gene expression profile was identified and was markedly different from the ERalpha signature.;	Conclusion: Expression of ERbeta is an independent marker for favorable prognosis after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in ERalpha-negative breast cancer patients, and involves a gene expression program;	distinct from ERalpha. These results may be highly clinically significant, because in the U.S. alone, approximately 10,000 women are diagnosed annually with ERalpha-negative/ERbeta-positive breast carcinoma and may benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen.;	Keywords: Disease state analysis",NA,88 breast cancer tumor samples were analyzed on 2-color cDNA microarrays containing ~27K reporters with Stratagene Universal Human Reference RNA as the common reference sample.,2

A t-test was carried out in order to find a set of genes where the expression might predict clinical outcome. Two classifiers were used to evaluate the gene lists on the different data sets, a correlation-based classifier and a VFI (Voting Features Interval) classifier. We then evaluated the predictive accuracy of this expression signature on tumour sets from two similar studies on lymph-node negative patients which had developed gene expression signatures superior to current methods in classifying node-negative breast tumours. These two signatures were also tested on our material.;	;	Results;	A list of 51 genes whose expression profiles could predict clinical outcome with high accuracy in our material (96% or 89% accuracy in cross-validation, depending on type of classifier) was developed. When tested on two independent data sets, the expression signature based on the 51 identified genes had good predictive qualities in one of  the data sets (74% accuracy), whereas their predictive value on the other data set were poor, presumably due to the fact that only 23 of the 51 genes were found in that material. We also found that previously developed expression signatures could predict clinical outcome well to moderately well in our material (72% and 61%, respectively). ;	;	Conclusion;	The list of 51 genes derived in this study might have potential for clinical utility as a prognostic gene set, and may include candidate genes of potential relevance for clinical outcome in breast cancer.

GSE16391,GPL570,NA,18260,48,GGI: a potential predictor of relapse for endocrine-treated breast cancer patients in the BIG 1-98 trial,19573224,"Background: We have previously shown that the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) was able to identify two subtypes of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors that were associated with statistically distinct clinical outcomes in both untreated and tamoxifen-treated patients. Here, we aim to investigate the ability of the GGI to predict relapses in postmenopausal women who were treated with tamoxifen (T) or letrozole (L) within the BIG 1-98 trial.;	Methods: We generated gene expression profiles (Affymetrix) and computed the GGI for a matched, case-control sample of patients enrolled in the BIG 1-98 trial from the two hospitals where frozen samples were available. All relapses (cases) were identified from patients randomized to receive monotherapy or from the switching treatment arms for whom relapse occurred before the switch.  Each case was randomly matched with four controls based upon nodal status and treatment (T or L).  The prognostic value of GGI was assessed as a continuous predictor and divided at the median.  Predictive accuracy of GGI was estimated using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves. ;	Results:  Frozen samples were analyzable for 48 patients (10 cases and 38 controls).  Seven of the 10 cases had been assigned to receive L. Cases and controls were comparable with respect to menopausal and nodal status, local and chemotherapy, and HER2 positivity. Cases were slightly older than controls and had a larger proportion of large, poorly differentiated ER+/PgR- tumors.  The GGI was significantly and linearly related to risk of relapse: each 10-unit increase in GGI resulted in an increase of approximately 11% in the hazard rate (p=0.02).  Within the subgroups of patients with node-positive disease or who were treated with L, the hazard of relapse was significantly greater for patients with GGI at or above the median. AUC reached a maximum of 78% at 27 months.;	Conclusions: This analysis supports the GGI as a good predictor of relapse for ER-positive patients, even among patients who receive L.  Validation of these results, in a larger series from BIG 1-98, is planned using the simplified GGI represented by a smaller set of genes and tested by qRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded tissues.

GSE16446,GPL570,NA,18260,114,Multifactorial Approach to Predicting Resistance to Anthracyclines,21422418,"PURPOSE: Validated biomarkers predictive of response/resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancer are currently lacking. The neoadjuvant TOP trial, in which patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors were treated with anthracycline (epirubicin) monotherapy, was specifically designed to evaluate the predictive value of topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) and to develop a gene expression signature to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines.;	;	METHODS: The TOP trial included 149 patients, of which 141 were evaluable for response prediction analyses. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR). TOP2A and gene expression profiles were evaluated using pre-epirubicin biopsies. Gene expression data from ER-negative samples of the EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 and MDACC 2003-0321 neoadjuvant trials were used for validation purposes.;	;	RESULTS: A pCR was obtained in 14% of the evaluable TOP patients. TOP2A amplification, but not protein overexpression, was significantly associated with pCR (p=0.001 and 0.22). We developed an “anthracycline-based score (A-Score)” that combines three signatures: a TOP2A gene signature and two previously published signatures related to tumor invasion and immune response. The A-Score was characterized by a high negative predictive value (NPV=0.98 [95% CI: 0.90-1.00]) overall, and in the HER2-negative and HER2-positive subpopulations. Its performance was independently confirmed in the anthracycline-based (FAC/FEC) arms of the two validation trials (BIG 00-01: 0.80 [0.61-0.92] and MDACC 2003-0321: 1.00 [0.80-1.00]).;	;	CONCLUSION: Given its high NPV, the A-Score could become, if further validated, a useful clinical tool to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines and could therefore be spared the non-negligible side effects.",NA,"Predicting the efficacy of anthracyclines (epirubicin) in breast cancer (BC) patients (TOP trial);	;	120 microarray experiments from primary ER-negative breast tumors of anthracycline-treated patients.;	;	No replicate, no reference sample.",1

These studies often consider breast cancer as a homogeneous entity, although higher rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) are known to occur within the basal-like subclass. We postulated that profiles with higher predictive accuracy could be derived from a subset analysis of basal-like tumors in isolation. Using a previously described ‘‘intrinsic’’ signature to differentiate breast tumor subclasses, we identified 50 basal-like tumors from two independent clinical trials associated with gene expression profile data. 24 tumor data sets (included in this GEO submission) were derived from a 119-patient neoadjuvant trial at our institution and an additional 26 tumor data sets were identified from a published data set (Hess et al. J Clin Oncol 24:4236–4244, 2006). The combined 50 basal-like tumors were partitioned to form a 37 sample training set with 13 sequestered for validation. Clinical surveillance occurred for a mean of 26 months. We identified a 23-gene profile which predicted pCR in basal-like breast cancers with 92% predictive accuracy in the sequestered validation data set. Furthermore, distinct cluster of patients with high rates of cancer recurrence was observed based on cluster analysis with the 23-gene signature. Disease-free survival analysis of these three clusters revealed significantly reduced survival in the patients of this high recurrence cluster. We identified a 23- gene signature which predicts response of basal-like breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as disease-free survival.

Good risk (NKI low, ROR-S low risk, Wound Healing quiescent, p53 wild type) signatures were associated with significantly higher 3-year RFS than poor risk expression signatures (ROR-S high risk, Wound Healing Activated, p53 mutation, NKI high risk).Conclusion: Importantly, in this set of biologically poor prognosis tumors, pCR predicts for better outcome, especially when analyzed within breast cancer subsets.;	;	Keywords: reference x sample",NA,reference x sample,2

When stratified by genomic subtype, subjects of the HER2-enriched subtype had the best response (66.7%), the luminal A (11%) and B (4.8%) subtypes the poorest. Of 147 patients tested for p53 mutations using the AmpliChip test, 78 variants were detected; 55 were missense. The response rate among TP53 mutated patients was 30%, significantly higher than the rate in TP53 wild-type patients (10%, P = .0032). Concordance between AmpliChip mutation status versus IHC staining was 65%, with AmpliChip status being predictive of response and IHC status being not being predictive. Conclusion: Capecitabine plus docetaxel in HER2-negative subjects, and with trastuzumab in HER2-positive subjects, provided a good response rate with fewer cycles. p53 mutational analysis using the AmpliChip p53 assay, and genomic subtyping using the PAM50 assay, were promising predictive tests of response.;	",NA,reference x sample,2
GSE23428,GPL5325,NA,16823,16,TBCRC 001:  Randomized Phase II Study of Cetuximab in Combination with Carboplatin in Stage IV Triple Negative Breast Cancer,22665533,"Abstract;	Background. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a targetable molecule in basal-like breast cancer, which comprises most “triple negative” breast cancer (TNBC), the only breast cancer subtype without established targeted therapy.;	Methods. In this randomized phase II trial, metastatic TNBC patients received the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (250mg/kg/week iv) with carboplatin (AUC2/wk iv) added on progression, or concomitant cetuximab + carboplatin. Molecular subtyping was done on archival specimens and those with accessible tumors provided fresh tissue, before and after 7-14 days of therapy, for microarray analyses to explore EGFR pathway inhibition.;	Results. Of 102 TNBC patients 74% were of the basal-like molecular subtype.  Response rate to cetuximab was 6% (2/31), and was 16% (4/25) to cetuximab + carboplatin after progression. Upfront cetuximab + carboplatin produced responses in 17% (12/71); 31% responded or had prolonged disease stabilization. Time to progression was 2.1 months (95% CI 1.8-5.5) and overall survival 10.4 months (95% CI 7.7-13.1) for those treated with the combination regimen. Among 16 patients with evaluable serial biopsies, genomic patterns of the EGFR pathway showed activated status in 13 and inhibition by therapy in 5.;	Conclusions.  While most TNBC were basal-like, a significant proportion were different subtypes. The aggressive nature of metastatic TNBC leads to limited survival. Despite a promising preclinical rationale and evidence of EGFR pathway activation in most, targeted treatment with cetuximab as a single agent had marginal activity and cetuximab added to carboplatin demonstrated modest activity.  Serial biopsies as part of metastatic breast cancer studies are feasible, and this study confirmed that the EGFR pathway was inhibited by therapy in only a minority suggesting ligand-independent activation in most tumors. Tissue acquisition and drug selection based upon individualized pathway activation status should be an important part of future studies of TNBC.",NA,"This series contains 36 microarrays that are from 18 patients with fresh frozen tissue  available from the metastatic site.  Pretreatment samples (Bx0) are available for two patients.  Pretreatment and post single agent treatment (7-14 days after start of treatment with cetuximab; BxSingle) are available for three patients.  Pretreatment and post combination treatment (7-14 days after start of treatment with cetuximab plus carboplatin; BxCombo) are available for eight patients.  Two patients have a pretreatment sample, a sample after 7-14 days of treatment with single agent cetuximab, and a third sample 7-14 days on cetuximab plus carboplatin after switching to the combination arm upon progression on the single agent arm.;	Samples were hybridized with Stratagene common reference spiked with RNA from two breast cancer cell lines (ME16C and MCF-7) on Custom 1x44K Agilent microarrays.  Arrays were scanned on an Axon 4000B scanner and analyzed with GenePix Pro software.;	;	",2

GSE32646,GPL570,NA,18260,115,GSTP1 expression predicts poor pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer,22320227,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression with resistance to neoadjuvant paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (P-FEC) in human breast cancers. The relationship of GSTP1 expression and GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation with intrinsic subtypes was also investigated. In this study, primary breast cancer patients (n = 123, stage II-III) treated with neoadjuvant P-FEC were analyzed. Tumor samples were obtained by vacuum-assisted core biopsy before P-FEC. GSTP1 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry, GSTP1 promoter methylation index (MI) using bisulfite methylation assay and intrinsic subtypes using DNA microarray. The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher in GSTP1-negative tumors (80.0%) than GSTP1-positive tumors (30.6%) (P = 0.009) among estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors but not among ER-positive tumors (P = 0.267). Multivariate analysis showed that GSTP1 was the only predictive factor for pCR (P = 0.013) among ER-negative tumors. Luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a significantly lower GSTP1 positivity than basal-like tumors (P = 0.002, P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively), while luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a higher GSTP1 MI than basal-like tumors (P = 0.076, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, these results suggest the possibility that GSTP1 expression can predict pathological response to P-FEC in ER-negative tumors but not in ER-positive tumors. Additionally, GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation might be implicated more importantly in the pathogenesis of luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors than basal-like tumors.",NA,Fresh frozen tumor samples obtained by vacuum-assisted core biopsy from one hundred and fifteen patients were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.,1

Preclinical studies suggest that complete blockade of the estrogen receptor (ER) combined with inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can overcome endocrine resistance. We tested this hypothesis in a phase II neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole and fulvestrant combined with gefitinib in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer.
