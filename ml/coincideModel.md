The Coincide meta-clustering procedure classifies tumor subtypes with prognostic power comparable to the PAM50 centroids using the same 50 gene subset.  The ROC curves below compare logistic regression models predicting 3 different long term (> 3 year) treatment outcomes using subtype label and three binary treatment variables from _curatedBreastData_:  `chemotherapy`, `anti-estrogen`, and `anti-HER2`.
